      <p>Our <strong>focus group discussion</strong> on January 26th, 2025, gave us deep insights into user preferences and pain points.</p>

    content: `
      <p>On January 20th, 2025, we hosted our first <strong>roadshow testing event</strong>. 
      This was a major milestone for Maibel.ai as we took our AI-powered wellness coach 
      to real users and received invaluable feedback.</p>

      <h2>üîç Key Insights from the Roadshow</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personalization is key:</strong> Users loved customizing their AI coach's personality.</li>
        <li><strong>Gamification works:</strong> The ability to unlock storylines motivated users to stay engaged.</li>
        <li><strong>Community support:</strong> Many testers emphasized the need for a stronger peer support system.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We are now working on refining the AI responses based on real-life interactions to make them even more intuitive.</p>

      <h2>üöÄ What's Next?</h2>
      <p>Following the roadshow, we will be iterating on our coaching model and preparing for the <strong>focus group discussion</strong> happening on January 26th.</p>
